# MetaCrafters Beginner Course Assignment
This repository contains the code for the MetaCrafters beginner course assignment. The goal of the assignment is to create an NFT collection using the CryptoPoops contract. The code includes the implementation of the borrowNFT function, as well as transaction and script examples.

# Features
The CryptoPoops contract provides the following features:

Creation of NFTs with unique properties such as name, favorite food, and lucky number.
Depositing and withdrawing NFTs to/from a collection.
Borrowing NFTs from a collection.

# How to Run the Project
To run the project and interact with the CryptoPoops contract, you can follow these steps:

Open the Flow Playground in your web browser.

Copy the code from the CryptoPoops.cdc file and paste it into the code editor in the Flow Playground.

In the "Transactions" section, you can execute the provided transactions (transaction1 and transaction2) and the script (script) by clicking on the "Run" button next to each transaction or script.

transaction1: This transaction allows you to send an NFT to a specified recipient. Replace the values for recipient, name, favouriteFood, and luckyNumber with the desired values. Click "Run" to execute the transaction.

transaction2: This transaction creates an empty collection for the account. Click "Run" to execute the transaction.

script: This script retrieves the first borrowed NFT from the account's collection. Replace the account parameter with the desired account address. Click "Run" to execute the script.

You can view the transaction/script result in the "Execution" section.
